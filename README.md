# Deformed-SYK-Numerics

Numerics for the SYK model and its deformations.

The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a quantum mechanical model of interest in the study of condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. 

These numerics were developed for research projects looking at deformed versions of the SYK:
