# Deformed-SYK-Numerics

Numerics for the SYK model and its deformations.

The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a quantum mechanical model of interest in the study of condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. 
These numerics were developed for research projects looking at deformed versions of the SYK: see JHEP 11 (2023) 197 (and further work to be published).

More detailed documentation on the numerics will be published soon.
